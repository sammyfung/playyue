Playing Cantonese (Yue) pronunciation

Using Audio Web API in javascript to play the pronunciation in modern web browsers.

The data in a CUHK Chinese Character Database provides valuable Cantonese pronunciation but the Web interface of the database is outdated. Therefore I create this open source project to play the pronunciation.
